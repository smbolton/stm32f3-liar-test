stm32f3-liar-test
=================

This is some work-in-progress test code for the `liar benchmarking crate
<https://github.com/ranweiler/liar>`_. At present, it is able to compile and
run liar on an STM32F3 Discovery board, benchmark short functions using the
Cortex-M DWT cycle counter, and present very simple results via semihosting.

This is built on top of Jorge Aparicio's embedded Rust work, including the
`xargo <https://github.com/japaric/xargo>`_ cross-compilation tool and his
`Cortex-M <https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-rt>`_ runtime. If you can get his
`quickstart examples <http://blog.japaric.io/quickstart/>`_ running, you should
be able to run this in much the same way.

Output
------
Right now, the code just dumps the `liar::no_std::runner::Samples` struct for each
test run. I modified my copy of liar to perform 10 iterations per run_loop()
with 4 samples per run(), so that it wouldn't take all day nor spew pages of
output. The output looks like this:

::
