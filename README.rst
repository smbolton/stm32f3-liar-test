stm32f3-liar-test
=================

This is some very-WIP test code for the `liar benchmarking crate
<https://github.com/ranweiler/liar>`_. At present, it is able to compile and
run liar on an STM32F3 Discovery board, but without meaningful results, since
I haven't written a timing source yet.

This draws heavily from Jorge Aparicio's embedded Rust work, in particular
`this blog post <http://blog.japaric.io/quickstart/>`_. Everything used here
is Apache/MIT/ISC licensed, and my next commit ought to be better attribution
of sources and licensing.
